Upgrading From SFS 0.6 to SFS 0.7
==================================

I. Introduction / Quick Setup
-----------------------------
Starting in release 0.7, SFS will have a new authentication server,
authentication protocol, and pathname syntax.  The new versions of
SFS will not be fully backwards compatible with the old. Here are 
the quick steps to take to upgrade your configuration files
after installing new binaries:

	1. Update sfs_users
	-------------------
       	    Run:

		perl sfsauthd/upgradedb.pl

	    By default, the script will operate on the sfs_users
	    file in /etc/sfs.  You can alternatively specify files
	    to upgrade on the command line, or try the -a flag to
	    upgrade all sfs_users files found with the locate utility.
	    If you do not explicitly specify files to upgrade, the
	    utility will prompt for confirmation on a file-by-file
	    basis.
	
	2. Upgrade sfsauthd_config file 
	-------------------------------- 
	    The standard Userfile line is now:
		
		Userfile -passwd -update -pub=<file>.pub <file> 

	    Where <file> is one of the system's sfs_users files.  An
	    empty sfsauthd_config file will be interpreted as above,
	    where <file> is the first sfs_users file found in the 
	    SFS configuration directories. 


II. SFS Pathnames
-----------------
Up to release 0.6, SFS pathnames were of the form:

	<Hostname>:<HostId>[@<port>]
	/sfs/pitt.scs.cs.nyu.edu:eigp6w44ddevhm64h4bx7jwqthtgt22g

As of release 0.7, SFS pathnames are of the form:

	@<Hostname>[%<port>],<HostId>
	/sfs/@pitt.scs.cs.nyu.edu,rexmmr795q6enmhsemr5xt5f6jjhjm6h

Note that the HostId has changed; HostID was previously determined by: 

	SHA-1 (sfs_hostinfo, sfs_hostinfo)

where sfs_hostinfo contained the hostname, and the host's public key, among
other things.  In release 0.7, HostID is given by:

	SHA-1 ( SHA-1 (pubkey), pubkey)

The new HostID does not contain a reference to the hostname; this 
facilitates -- among other things -- SFS between DHCP'ed laptops.

It is recommended that all symlinks referring to the old SFS pathname be
upgraded to the new SFS pathname format, but there is no automated tool
for so doing at this time.  Upgrading is not essential, however. The new 
sfs*cd will recognize old pathnames, even if they refer to SFS servers that 
have been upgraded and run the new sfs*sd.


III. Backwards Compatibility
----------------------------

Eventually, all functionality particular to the old SFS will be phased out,
but for now, there are many incompatibilities between the old services 
and the new; they are shown in the matrix below.

	Compatibility Codes		Features
	----------------- 		---------
	N - Not compatible		A - sfsauthd
	T - Not fully tested, but 	B - sfskey add
            should be compatible	C - sfskey reg/update
	U - Needs upgrade		D - SRP serve or fetch
	Y - Compatible			E - sfsagent
	<blank> - N/A			F - sfsauthd_config
					G - sfs_users
					H - sfscd
					I - sfssd
					J - sfs pathnames

Note that SRP fetch and sfscd are compatible with older SFS servers.
