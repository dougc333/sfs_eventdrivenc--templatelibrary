==== Required stuff for next release:

* Have some story for administrative realms
  - finish incremental transfers, some kind of client authd authentication
  - document how to use this stuff

* Make REX work
  - Make sure session resumption is bullet-proof
  - finish GUI stuff (can't assume gtk-python)
  - STDIN/STDOUT problem when using CVS_RSH=rex (non-visible text)

* Do something intelligent with agent output

* Rewrite and audit UPDATE RPC code in sfsauthd

* Make rexd work well even if you aren't running sfscd on server

==== Stuff to do soon:

* Standalone mode for rex that doesn't require agent (as when you
  borrow a friend's terminal).

* Get revocation/forwarding support working in sfskey, sfssd

* Automatic proxy/NAT support

* Have some kind of built-in portmap in nfsmounter, if port 111
  unbound, to avoid problems when people don't run portmap.

* Check ownership of tcp sockets when possible in listen (currently
  only works on BSD).

* Figure out OpenBSD/FreeBSD kernel panic

* Bug tracking, regular release engineering with accountability

==== Stuff to do eventually:

* IPv6
* Provable SRP primes
* Local login
* Break out private key into separate program
* Make timecb deal better with clock adjustments
* Compress traffic
* SFS-RO and Chefs
* Schnorr Key Generation: generate arbitrary-length schnorr keys.
* Simple password change program
* Document libasync
* Windows port possibly using FUSE
* Revamp Web pages, logo
